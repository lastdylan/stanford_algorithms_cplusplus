# Algorithms in C++

The class from which I did these assignments is open and free, and can be found at https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/about
I aim to make every assignment an executable, located in the bin/ directory. With time, I will be putting instructions on how to run each of them.
